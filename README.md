# Scanning-Local-Network-for-Open-Ports
First we have to install npcap for nmap scanning 
Nmap is used to scan the ip address
nmap shows the open and closed ports on the ip address 
In windows to know the ip address of our machine we have to open terminal and enter command "ipconfig"
In Linux to know the ip address of our machine we have to open terminal and enter command "ifconfig"
After entering the command we get ip address of our machine 
Now open the nmap to scan the open and closed ports on our ip address
